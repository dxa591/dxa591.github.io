      <h3>Proposal to Develop Oak Bridge</h3>
      <p>Oak Bridge is one of the main communities within the Sawgrass Players Club community.  It holds a golf course, tennis courts, and residential area that include 354 homes. It is the oldest community in the neighborhood.
      </p>

      <p>Oak Bridge was formally owned by Jamey Golf. He was the owner for a number of years and possibly due to the declining course, had trouble paying the mortgage payments to First Atlantic bank.
      </p>

      <p>A firm led by Dave Miller named Alta Mar Holding bought that mortgage note from First Atlantic Bank at a discount because it was non performing. They purchased the note anticipating a buyer would come along and buy out the former owner Jamey Golf and they would turn a profit.
      </p>

      <p>Alta Mar reached out to a number of buyers such as Beacon Sports and the PGA Tour, but they weren’t interested because of a large value of capital improvements required to repair and replace the neglected assets. They believe the repairs needed to improve the course and assets don’t add enough value to make it a long term investment.
      </p>

      <p>In summer of 2015 Jamey Golf couldn’t make payment on the mortgage so Alta Mar initiated foreclosure on Mr. Golf.  Because of this Alta Mar eventually took ownership in February 2016.
      </p>

      <p>“I was the lender of the note and it foreclosed on the course, so it ended up in my lap and I tried to make lemonade out of lemons.” Dave Miller.
      </p>

      <p>Alta Mar believes there are 5 million dollars in required upgrades within Oak Bridge and because of the decline in the golf course, they believe that it will impact people property values not only in Oak Bridge, but throughout the player’s homeowners association.,
      </p>

      <p>Alta Mar is now proposing new changes to Oak Bridge to make it more financially viable. They believe they won’t be able to sustain it at the current operating level. They can’t justify spending 3.9 million dollars in golf improvements while operating at a loss of 50k per month.
      </p>

      <p>“We have to make this course more appealing, because right now hardly anyone wants to play because of the condition it is in. A lot of the expenses we incur on the golf course will happen regardless of the revenue associated with the course and in my opinion we have to make this course better to make it appealing for the average golfer so they can spend 40 to 50 bucks. We are limping along certainly better than 3 months ago when we took over, but it’s not a good experience out there.” Dave Miller
      </p>

      <p>Some of those proposed upgrades include $1.5 million in fairway and green reconstruction, 500k in a new tennis facility and clubhouse,$1.8 million irrigation system, a new driving range and 500k going towards the new golf clubhouse.  Miller believes  all of these changes won’t be impacted by the direction the course goes.
      </p>

      <p>“New tennis courts, rebuilt tennis clubhouse, redone golf clubhouse golf pro shop, driving range. All are sustainable and will exist no matter where course goes in the future. The big money is on the course.”
          Miller currently has two of the top restaurateurs in Ponte Vedra helping with the new clubhouse.
      </p>

      <p>“The owners of 11 South and Caps are here right now, so we are all in the process of putting a  half million dollars inside the club house with an outside canopy. This is a collaboration of two of the top restaurateurs in Ponte Vedra that will operate a vibrant community base.”
      </p>

      <p>The condition of the course wasn’t exactly in the best of shape when he purchased it.
      </p>

      <p>“It was terrible every facet what you see her to what you don’t see. The maintenance was terrible the greens were terrible the tennis courts were terrible.” Dave Miller
      </p>

      <p>Taking a tour of the course you can easily see the depreciation. The grass is worn and patchy on not only the fairways, but also the rough and greens. There were at least 4 sprinkler heads that were heavily spilling water, creating a large puddle near it. Because of these broken sprinklers impacting the water pressure, many of the areas are not getting the necessary water to grow. Some of the others things I saw were cracked and uneven foundations on the cart paths, outdated maintenance equipment and even the main fountain was broken.
      </p>

      <p>Their main solution is to repurpose a portion of the golf course to make it financially viable. Their answer on how to do that is to propose an age restricted continuing care and a nonprofit civic institution at the portion of the golf course that is repurposed. This means they will want to sell off roughly 40 acres of the golf course and turn it into continuing care homes. On top of that they want to give the community access directly from A1A to limit traffic in the other neighborhoods. In the past Oak Bridge used to have a gate at A1A.
      </p>

      <p>“I think I’m doing everything I can do, but at a certain point it requires community commitment. That community commitment is allowing us to carve off that 40 acres out by A1A, which is 25 percent of the course and redeploy the proceeds of that to fix the course. “ Dave Miller
      </p>

      <p>I also saw the area where Oak Bridge is planning on modifying the golf course. Essentially two of the holes adjacent to A1A are being planned to be taken out in favor of the continuing care retirement community. Many people are worried that the construction will impact their homes along the golf course. However when looking at where they are proposing the modifications on those two holes, there are only a couple houses that will be near the construction. To give perspective the main area of construction will be behind the business centers in Sawgrass Village such as “The Falls”
      </p>

      <p>All of these proposed changes are in limbo right now due to the deed restriction on the golf course that is active until 2023. If they get a yes vote, taking the deed restriction off, then they have to go get country approval. When they get that they will have an entitled zone property, which they will offer to a place like Vicars Landing.
      </p>

      <p>Some residents are wary about the new proposed modifications and constructions, due to no one knowing who Alta Mar is and what they plan to do to their golf course. Some are also worried about whether they will sell off the proceeds and not invest back in the golf course. Dave Miller says that is not the case.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m willing to put a percentage of the proceeds in escrow because one of the main questions is are you going to try and sell this off and not reinvest in golf course? I am willing to put 2 million dollars or a percentage of proceeds to reassure the community of my commitment.” Dave Miller
      </p>

      <p> All the new owners can do is show they want to make this work through the money they are putting into this golf course to make it viable. Miller believes recent success improving Vicars and Sawgrass Village help his cause.
      </p>

      <p>“The greater community.in Ponte Vedra needs an economically friendly place to play golf that is a good experience. Not everyone can pay $500 at TPC or $200 at Dye Valley. Not everyone can be member at Sawgrass or Marsh Landing.  Our community deserves this. Look at vicars or sawgrass village; you saw how change can be for the better. Look at the success of those renovations, They both went through a reinvestment recently and look how they came out.” Dave Miller
      </p>

      <p>What residents in the area must know is that if the proposed plan doesn’t go through, there will be no financial reason for the new owners to stay with this project and continue to help with the back 9. Oak Bridge will continue to depreciate and in turn the value of housing will go down in all of Sawgrass.
      </p>

      <p>“The choices we all face are simple. Either we are going to carve out the 40 acres and invest in golf course, gaining a reduced but much improved oak bridge or if they vote it down we have to react to the economics from now until 2023. If that happens we will shut down the back nine immediately and let it go fallow. If we can’t make it as a nine hole course we will abandon it until 2023 when we are allowed to monetize the 40 acres. “ Dave Miller
