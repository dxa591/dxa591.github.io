      <h3>You Just Might Be a Dinosaur</h3>

      <p>How do you know if you're a dinosaur? Well, if you're bigger than a school bus, can eat everything in the fridge in one bite, and have dozens of razor-sharp teeth, it's possible you may just be a dinosaur! This is just one example of Ponte Vedra Beach author Heather Macht’s first children’s book “You just may be a dinosaur!” Her picture book combines facts about dinosaurs in a fun and engaging way for kids.
      </p>
      <p>Heather’s fun nature and love for dinosaurs started when she herself was a child. “I’ve been writing since the 3rd grade about dinosaurs, sometimes instead of doing serious class assignments I would draw Dinosaurs wearing sunglasses and riding skateboards.” On top of writing she also loves going to museums to see the dinosaur exhibits
      </p>
      <p>That fun attitude stayed with her, but like most people Macht took a steady job after college working at property at property and casualty insurance for the past ten years. She continued to love dinosaurs throughout those years and only until recently with her first child Hunter Oz being born did she feel the need to go after her dream.
      </p>
      <p>As a children’s book author her connection with kids starts at home with her son Hunter. His room is even filled with dinosaur toys, pictures, and stuffed animals. This book is dedicated to Hunter Oz and while he may not understand everything at 2 years old her love for Hunter should help her to connect with other children who read her book.
      </p>
      <p>While she likes to have fun and laugh, this book is also very informative. There are fun facts about dinosaurs and it helps to get your child to learn, while enjoying the experience. So informative in fact that two paleontologists have endorsed her book. Joseph J Kchodl believes it’s "A wonderful, fanciful look at Dinosaurs. Sure to excite youthful readers." Dr Jeb Bevers, a member of the society of Vertebrae Paleontology also exclaimed  “This book is a fun and fact filled read for young children and the young at heart. Even a dinosaur would enjoy reading it”
      </p>
      <p>Saturday Oct 3 at 2:00pm Heather will be at the Barnes and Nobles at the town center to unveil her new book. It’s free and will include an interactive story time and dinosaur face painting for the kids. If your kids love dinosaurs come out, because who said learning about the can’t be fun!?
